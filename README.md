### I am a Frontend Developer at [AIA Singapore]('https://www.aia.com.sg/).

Recently, I registered as Analyst/Engineer for AIA eBenefit, a mobile app available for [`iOS`](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/aia-ebenefits-app/id1523776118) and [`Android`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aia.ebenefitsapp&hl=en_US). Written in latest [`React-Native`](https://reactnative.dev/blog), AIA eBenefit is already used by hundreds of thousands of people and has reached the top three in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/charts/iphone/medical-apps/6020) medical category. I do fix bugs, enhance features, and improve the app with developer team based on user feedback.

As a JavaScript enthusiast ðŸš€, I am excited about the many frameworks and libraries available that allow us to explore and learn new things. I am particularly excited about the latest version of NextJS, which supports full-stack development.
